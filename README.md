# Crusader Kings III mod

This repository contains some Python scripts I am using in the development of a mod for the Crusader Kings III game.

Install the scripts:

```shell
pip3 install .
```

Run tests:

```shell
python3 -m unittest
```

## Usage

For now, there is only one script, which can be invoked from the command line with:

```shell
copy_replace
```
